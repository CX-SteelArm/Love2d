Spirograph is a well-known toy which can generate many splendid curves by a pencil, an outer plate and a round or irregular-shaped plate with small holes in it. These curves are named as hypotrochoid (内转迹线 in Chinese) in mathematics.

This program is a very simple simulation of the hypotrochoid.

Gspot.lua is a GUI library, I have modified it to fit the needs.

Parameters:

R: Radius of the outer plate(a circle).

r: Radius of the inner plate(a circle).

d: distance between the hole and the center of the inner plate.

Buttons:

screenShot: screenshot.

saveExpre: save the expression of the current curve. (saved in outputExpression.txt)

Grid: show/hide the frame.

codes in __main.lua can support ellipse inner plate.
